; Stage 1 bootloader
; This bootloader will load the next stage of the bootloader from the first sector of the
; first disk and jump to it.

; The bootloader will be loaded at physical address 0x00008000, so we need to use
; relative addressing to access data and code.

; Set up the stack pointer
mov sp, #0x00008000      ; Set the stack pointer to the correct location

; Read the first sector of the first disk into memory
mov x0, #0x00008000      ; Load the destination address into x0
mov x1, #0x00000001      ; Load the sector number into x1
mov x2, #0x00000000      ; Load the disk number into x2
mov x3, #disk_read       ; Load the address of the disk read function into x3
blr x3                   ; Call the disk read function

; Check if the read was successful
cmp x0, #0               ; Compare the return value to 0
beq boot_error           ; If the values are equal, there was an error

; Jump to the second stage bootloader
ldr x0, =0x00008000      ; Load the address of the second stage bootloader into x0
br x0                    ; Jump to the second stage bootloader

boot_error:
; Print an error message
mov x0, #0x00000065      ; Load the ASCII code for the letter 'E' into x0
mov x1, #0x00000000      ; Load the stdout file descriptor into x1
mov x2, #write           ; Load the address of the write function into x2
blr x2                   ; Call the write function
mov x0, #0x00000072      ; Load the ASCII code for the letter 'R' into x0
blr x2                   ; Call the write function
mov x0, #0x00000072      ; Load the ASCII code for the letter 'R' into x0
blr x2                   ; Call the write function
mov x0, #0x0000006f      ; Load the ASCII code for the letter 'O' into x0
blr x2                   ; Call the write function
mov x0, #0x00000072      ; Load the ASCII code for the letter 'R' into x0
blr x2                   ; Call the write function
b .                      ; Loop forever

disk_read:
; This function reads a sector from the disk and stores it in memory
; Parameters:
;   x0 - destination address
;   x1 - sector number
;   x2 - disk number
; Return value:
;   x0 - 0 if successful, -1 if error

; Implementation details will depend on the specific hardware and operating system being used.
